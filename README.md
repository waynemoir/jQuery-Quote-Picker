jQuery Quote Picker
============

A jQuery based quote picker that parses an XML file of quotes and outputs a different one at random on page load.

Traditionally, and probably ideally, this functionallity would be handled with server side code. This project came about from a need to provide this functionallity on a documentation site built using flat HTML and deployed in an enviornment where server side scripting was unavailable.
