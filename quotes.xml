	<quote title="Dieter Rams" url="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669725/dieter-rams-on-good-design-as-a-key-business-advantage">
		<text>Good design: Is innovative - The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</text>

	<quote title="Dieter Rams" url="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669725/dieter-rams-on-good-design-as-a-key-business-advantage">
		<text>Good design: Makes a product useful - A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</text>

		<text>Good design: Makes a product understandable - It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user's intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.</text>

	<quote title="Dieter Rams" url="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669725/dieter-rams-on-good-design-as-a-key-business-advantage">
		<text>Good design: Is unobtrusive - Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</text>

	<quote title="Dieter Rams" url="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669725/dieter-rams-on-good-design-as-a-key-business-advantage">
		<text>Good design: Is honest - It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</text>

		<text>Good design: Is as little design as possible - Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.</text>

		<text>The real problem with the interface is that it is an interface. Interfaces get in the way. I don’t want to focus my energies on an interface. I want to focus on the job…I don’t want to think of myself as using a computer, I want to think of myself as doing my job.</text>

	<quote title="Cooper" url="">
		<text>It’s time for us to move beyond screen-based thinking. Because when we think in screens, we design based upon a model that is inherently unnatural, inhumane, and has diminishing returns. It requires a great deal of talent, money and time to make these systems somewhat usable, and after all that effort, the software can sadly, only truly improve with a major overhaul.</text>
